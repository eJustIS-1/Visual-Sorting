# Visual Sorter App

## Introduction

This project aims to create a Java application that generates and sorts random shapes through the use of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts and design patterns. The application provides an interface with two buttons, allowing users to load and sort the shapes dynamically.

## Tech Stack

- **Language:** Java
- **IDE:** Eclipse
- **Design Patterns:** Singleton, Factory
- **Sorting Algorithm:** Selection Sort

## Project Structure

### 1. Design of the Solution

- Utilized OOP concepts, including interfaces and design patterns (Singleton, Factory).
- Implemented a Shape interface with essential methods, adopted by Rectangle and Circle classes.
- Leveraged the ShapeFactory class for dynamic shape creation.

### 2. Implementation

- Developed the application in Eclipse IDE using Java-13 SDK.
- Created a MyPanel class for testing and validation.
- Implemented the Selection Sort algorithm for sorting shapes.

### 3. Usage

To run the application:

1. Open the project in Eclipse IDE.
2. Run the MyPanel class to test the functionality.
3. Use the load and sort buttons to interact with the application.

## Conclusion

The project was successfully executed, providing hands-on experience with Java development, design patterns, and OOP concepts. While faced with time constraints due to job interviews, the implementation effectively demonstrates the functionality of sorting random shapes.

Feel free to explore and enhance the application based on your requirements!
